# Welcome to Kalavai

> Kalavai is an **open source** platform that turns **everyday devices** into your very own AI supercomputer. We help you aggregate resources from multiple machines: home desktops, gaming laptops, work computers, cloud VMs... When you need to **go beyond**, Kalavai **facilitates matchmaking** of resources so anyone in our community can tap into a larger pool of devices by **inspiring others to join** your cause.

## What can you do with Kalavai

Kalavai helps manage the complexity of bringing Large Language Models and Agentic AI into practical applications. With Kalavai you can easily:

- **Deploy Large Language Models** in a single machine, or **seamlessly across multiple nodes**
- Run a **Ray cluster** for your AI **training, fine tuning and serving** needs

## Getting started

The best way to getting started is [joining our public shared pool](public_llm_pool.md), where you can share your computing resources with peers and deploy shared LLMs.

If you want to deploy kalavai yourself, check out our [start guide](getting_started.md) for a step-by-step guide on how to get started. This is the recommended entry point for those that wish to explore the basics of Kalavai.

For those that are more _shoot first, ask later_, we've prepared a [quick start tutorial](quickstart.md) that goes straight to the point, from downloading Kalavai to running your own LLM across community machines.
