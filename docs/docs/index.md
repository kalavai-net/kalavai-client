# Welcome to Kalavai

`Kalavai` is a marketplace for computation that solves the problem of inaccessible AI using consumer device hardware from our users. _Think Airbnb, but for computation_.

## The problem: inaccessible AI

Despite the hype of new models, **AI remains hard to leverage in real world scenarios**. We've been there, in startups, as AI developers. We have experienced how **expensive the hardware is** to procure; we've felt frustrated with **cloud providers rationing GPUs**; we've wasted countless hours in **devops rabbit-holes** configuring and managing multiple machines, distracted away from the actual fun of AI. All of this makes AI inaccessible for most.


## Easy infrastructure on a community-owned cloud

* As an AI developer **you have access affordable infrastructure** to run and fine tune AI models
* As a host, you **earn by sharing** your devices
