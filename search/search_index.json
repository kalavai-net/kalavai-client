We've been there, in startups, as AI developers.

All of this makes AI inaccessible for most.</p>"},{"location":"#easy-infrastructure-on-a-community-owned-cloud","title":"Easy infrastructure on a community-owned cloud","text":"<ul> <li>As an AI developer you have access affordable infrastructure to run and fine tune AI models</li> <li>As a host, you earn by sharing your devices</li> </ul>"},{"location":"#want-to-know-more","title":"Want to know more?","text":"<p>We get it, you are curious.
