# Kalavai: turn your devices into a scalable LLM platform

### Taming the adoption of Large Language Models

> Kalavai is an **open source** tool that turns **everyday devices** into your very own LLM platform. It aggregates resources from multiple machines, including desktops and laptops, and is **compatible with most model engines** to make LLM deployment and orchestration simple and reliable.

## What can Kalavai do?

Kalavai's goal is to make using LLMs in real applications accessible and affordable to all. It's a _magic box_ that **integrates all the components required to make LLM useful in the age of massive computing**, from sourcing computing power, managing distributed infrastructure and storage, using industry-standard model engines and orchestration of LLMs. 

### Core features

- Manage **multiple devices resources as one**. One pool of RAM, CPUs and GPUs
- **Deploy Large Language Models seamlessly across devices**, wherever they are (multiple clouds, on premises, personal devices)
- Auto-discovery: all **models are automatically exposed** through a single OpenAI-like API and a ChatGPT-like UI playground
- Compatible with [most popular model engines](#support-for-llm-engines)
- [Easy to expand](https://github.com/kalavai-net/kube-watcher/tree/main/templates) to custom workloads

## Getting started

The `kalavai-client` is the main tool to interact with the Kalavai platform, to create and manage both local and public pools and also to interact with them (e.g. deploy models). Let's go over its installation. 

From release **v0.5.0, you can now install `kalavai-client` in non-worker computers**. You can run a pool on a set of machines and have the client on a remote computer from which you access the LLM pool. Because the client only requires having python installed, this means more computers are now supported to run it.


<details>

<summary>Requirements</summary>

### Requirements

For workers sharing resources with the pool:

- A laptop, desktop or Virtual Machine
- Docker engine installed (for [linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/), [Windows and MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/)) with [privilege access](https://docs.docker.com/engine/containers/run/#runtime-privilege-and-linux-capabilities).

> **Support for Windows and MacOS workers is experimental**: kalavai workers run on docker containers that require access to the host network interfaces, thus systems that do not support containers natively (Windows and MacOS) may have difficulties finding each other.

Any system that runs python 3.6+ is able to run the `kalavai-client` and therefore connect and operate an LLM pool, [without sharing with the pool](). Your computer won't be adding its capacity to the pool, but it wil be able to deploy jobs and interact with models.

<summary> Common issues</summary>

If you see the following error:

```bash
fatal error: Python.h: No such file or directory | #include <Python.h>
```

Make sure you also install python3-dev package. For ubuntu distros:

```bash
sudo apt install python3-dev
```

If you see:
```bash
AttributeError: install_layout. Did you mean: 'install_platlib'?
      [end of output]
```

Upgrade your setuptools:
```bash
pip install -U setuptools
```
</details>

### Install the client

The client is a python package and can be installed with one command:

```bash
pip install kalavai-client
```


## Createa a local, private LLM pool

> Kalavai is **free to use, no caps, for both commercial and non-commercial purposes**. All you need to get started is one or more computers that can see each other (i.e. within the same network), and you are good to go. If you are interested in join computers in different locations / networks, [contact us](mailto:info@kalavai.net) or [book a demo](https://app.onecal.io/b/kalavai/book-a-demo) with the founders.

You can create and manage your pools with the new kalavai GUI, which can be started with:

```bash
kalavai gui start
```

This will expose the GUI and the backend services in localhost. By default, the GUI is accessible via [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). In the UI users can create and join LLM pools, monitor devices, deploy LLMs and more.

Check out our [getting started guide](https://kalavai-net.github.io/kalavai-client/getting_started/) for next steps.


## Public LLM pools: crowdsource community resources

This is the **easiest and most powerful** way to experience Kalavai. It affords users the full resource capabilities of the community and access to all its deployed LLMs, via an [OpenAI-compatible endpoint](https://kalavai-net.github.io/kalavai-client/public_llm_pool/#single-api-endpoint) as well as a [UI-based playground](https://kalavai-net.github.io/kalavai-client/public_llm_pool/#ui-playground).

Check out [our guide](https://kalavai-net.github.io/kalavai-client/public_llm_pool/) on how to join and start deploying LLMs.


## Enough already, let's run stuff!

Check our [examples](examples/) to put your new AI pool to good use!
- [Single node vLLM GPU LLM](examples/singlenode_gpu_vllm.md) deployment
- [Multi node vLLM GPU LLM](examples/multinode_gpu_vllm.md) deployment
- [Aphrodite-engine quantized LLM](examples/quantized_gpu_llm.md) deployment, including Kobold interface
- [Ray cluster](examples/ray_cluster.md) for distributed computation.


## Compatibility matrix

If your system is not currently supported, [open an issue](https://github.com/kalavai-net/kalavai-client/issues) and request it. We are expanding this list constantly.

<details>

**<summary>Hardware and OS compatibility </summary>**

### OS compatibility

Since **worker nodes** run inside docker, any machine that can run docker **should** be compatible with Kalavai. Here are instructions for [linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), [Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/) and [MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/).

The kalavai client, which controls and access pools, can be installed on any machine that has python 3.10+.


### Hardware compatibility:

- `amd64` or `x86_64` CPU architecture
- NVIDIA GPU
- AMD and Intel GPUs are currently not supported ([interested in helping us test it?](https://kalavai-net.github.io/kalavai-client/compatibility/#help-testing-amd-gpus))
