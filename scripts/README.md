# Useful scripts

## Worker installers

Individual scripts to setup workers on various platforms. Workers are docker compose recipes that run kalavai-runner and vpn containers to connect to a pool. They do not include the kalavai-client. Workers are useful in organisations where you want to increase the computational workforce in machines where the client is not required (cloud instances, worker-only nodes).
